### What I learned
-  Using literal expressions to validate form fields



```js
function validateField(field, expRegex, errorElement, message) {
  if (field.value.match(expRegex)) {
    hiddenError(field, errorElement);
    return true;
  } else {
    showError(field, errorElement, message);
  }
  return false;
}
```
